# Global Tritium Scenarios

Attempt to recreate global tritium supply graphs found in the literature.

## Kovari (Pessimistic) Scenario Assumptions

There are 21.1 kg of tritium in 2006.
The power from 2015 was used for each reactor.

Canadian Tritium
* Canadian units will operate for 30 years from first connection to the grid or 25 years following refurbishment.
* The actual operating lifetime from 2006 until the publication date was considered for units above the 25- and 30- year threshold.
* Bruce 1, 2, 3, 4 and Pickering 1 and 4 have already undergone refurbishment.
* Pickering 2 and 3 are already permanently shutdown.
* Darlington-2 and Bruce-6 units will be refurbished, and no other refurbishments will occur. 
* Tritium production factor is 0.228 kg/GWe based on 2015 power (retrieved from IAEA website).
* Canadian tritium sales of 0.3 kg/year.

Korean Tritium 
* Korean extraction begins in July 2007 with the start if Wolsong Tritium Removal Facility (WTRF).
*	Wolsong 1-4 will run for 30 years from first connection to the grid and will not be refurbished.
*	Wolsong 1 was permanently shut down in 2022.
*	Tritium production factor is 0.2304 kg/GWe based on 2015 power (retrieved from IAEA website.
