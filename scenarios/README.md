# Global Tritium Scenarios

Attempt to recreate global tritium supply graphs found in the literature.

## Kovari (Pessimistic) Scenario Assumptions

There are 21.1 kg of tritium in 2006.
The power from 2015 was used for each reactor.

Canadian Tritium
* Canadian units will operate for 30 years from first connection to the grid or 25 years following refurbishment.
* The actual operating lifetime from 2006 until the publication date was considered for units above the 25- and 30- year threshold.
* Darlington-2 and Bruce-6 units will be refurbished, and no other refurbishments will occur. 
* Tritium production factor is 0.245 kg/GWe/fpy.
* Canadian tritium sales of 0.3 kg/year.

Korean Tritium 
•	Wolsong 1 was permanently shut down in 2022.
•	Wolsong 2-3 will run for 30 years from first connection to the grid and will not be refurbished.
•	Wolsong Tritium Removal Facility (WTRF) will operate until 2032 and still be able to remove tritium from the shutdown reactors. The reactor lifetimes include 18 months of post shutdown processing.
•	Wolsong 1 was permanently shut down in 2022.
•	Tritium production factor is 0.26 kg/GWe/fpy.
