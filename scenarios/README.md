# Global Tritium Scenarios

Attempt to recreate global tritium supply graphs found in the literature.

## Kovari (Pessimistic) Scenario Assumptions

There are 21.1 kg of tritium in 2006.
The power from 2015 was used for each reactor.

Canadian Tritium
* Canadian units will operate for 30 years from first connection to the grid or 25 years following refurbishment.
* The actual operating lifetime from 2006 until the publication date was considered for units above the 25- and 30- year threshold.
* Bruce 1, 2, 3, 4 and Pickering 1 and 4 have already undergone refurbishment.
* Pickering 2 and 3 are already permanently shutdown.
* Darlington-2 and Bruce-6 units will be refurbished, and no other refurbishments will occur. 
* Tritium production factor is 0.228 kg/GWe based on 2015 power (retrieved from IAEA website).
* Canadian tritium sales of 0.3 kg/year.

Korean Tritium 
* Korean extraction begins in July 2007 with the start if Wolsong Tritium Removal Facility (WTRF).
*	Wolsong 1-4 will run for 30 years from first connection to the grid and will not be refurbished.
*	Wolsong 1 was permanently shut down in 2022.
*	Tritium production factor is 0.2304 kg/GWe based on 2015 power (retrieved from IAEA website).

## Pearson Supply 1 Demand A Scenario Assumptions

The simulation starts in 1971.
ITER requires the following tritium: 100 g in 2027; 200 g in 2030; 800 g yearly from 2031 to 2034; 1100 g for 12 years starting in 2035.

Canadian Tritium
* Whan all Canadian units are operational, 1932 g of tritium are produced each year. Production is based on the proportion of power from the units that are online.
* Sales occur at a rate of 100 g/year.
* The known schedule for Canadian CANDU operation from 2017 was used.
* Units from Bruce, Darlington, Pickering, and Gentilly 2 were used in the simulation.

Korean Tritium 
* When all four Wolsong units are operational, 780 g of tritium are produced each year. Porduction is based on the proportion of units that are online.
*	Wolsong units will begin shutdown in 2022 with the last units shutting down by 2030.
*	Tritium extraction will occur at a reduced rate until 2032.(This is accounted for by keeping units 3 and 4 in the simulation until 2032).
